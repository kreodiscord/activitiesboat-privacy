# Privacy Policy

## Introduction
Welcome to **Prime**, your trusted Discord bot. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we collect and how we use and protect it when you use the **Prime Bot**. By using our bot, you agree to the terms described in this policy.

## Data Collection
When you use the `/activity` command, the bot may collect the following data:

- **User Information**: The bot collects your Discord username, user ID, and server information to execute the `/activity` command and provide you with a seamless experience.
- **Channel Information**: The bot collects the selected voice channel in your server to start the chosen activity.

We do **not** collect or store any personal information like email addresses, passwords, or other sensitive data.

## Data Usage
The data collected is used solely for the purpose of enabling the `/activity` command and starting the appropriate Discord activity in your selected voice channel.

- The bot will send a link to a Discord activity in the chosen voice channel.
- We do not share or use your data for any other purposes outside of the bot's core functionality.

## Data Retention
The bot does **not** store any data beyond the duration of the activity session. Once the activity ends, any collected data is discarded.

## Data Protection
We take appropriate measures to ensure that the data you provide is handled securely. However, please note that no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## Third-Party Services
Our bot may interact with third-party services (such as Discord's Activity API) to start the activities. These services may have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

## Contact
If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us through our support server.
